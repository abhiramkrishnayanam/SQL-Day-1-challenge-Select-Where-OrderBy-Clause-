# SQL SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY Clause Tutorial

This tutorial covers the basics of using SQL `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to retrieve and filter data from a database.

** SQL SELECT Clause**

The `SELECT` statement retrieves data from one or more tables. It allows you to choose specific columns or retrieve all columns using the `*` wildcard.

**Syntax:**
```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

** Where Clause**

The WHERE clause filters records based on specific conditions. Only the rows that meet the condition are returned.

**Syntax:**

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

** Order By**
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. You can sort the data in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

**Syntax:**

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
